# Robotics, Embedded and other tinkerings

Hi, I am an engineer, I like tinkering with machines. I have a few projects where I try out different things, for the sake of learning but my real love is for the machines that make our world spin, besides the black magic of Internet (and its everpresent shadow) I want to start a documentation as a way of inspiring me and commiting to playing with machines so that eventually I can mass produce a glorious army, so that I can send it to clean the bathroom.

And here I crave into bits and bytes, the unyielding will of the first machine god, that I need to keep writing.

## Computing and other programming stuff:

A few of the projects are mainly computing oriented, 

### Path Planning:

The idea was to create a user display to process a 2D map, read on CSV file to show the solutions of a path planning algorithm. Written in C++, implemented with the aid of SFML to show the path and the search space within the map. The next step is to add a GUI, so that the user can select the initial position and goals interactively.

Currently the only search algorithm implemented is A*.

### Probabilistic Robotics algorithms:

This is merely for the amusement and that once implemented, the algorithm becomes easier to understand. Probabilistic Robotics by Sebastian Thrun is one of those books that only with it's depth can fall over you mind and shatter it like some frail glass when you are unexperienced. Different algorithms withing the book deal with the randomness and data correlation so that a mobile robot can find it's way.

Nowadays I've only implemented the Kalman Linear Filter, which is more of a theoretical one but it is indeed deserving of some time.

## 3D printing

Additive manufacturing's capabilities within the rapid prototipying sector are astonishing for the hobbist, the printing results, the tolerances and ease of producing and testing designs are unmatched when paired with the patience of calibration.

The main goal here is to document the progress of the printing of a robotic arm, using the magic of embedded systems to make it move. For now, the stage we're in is the CAD of the parts to further printing and the potential use of NEMA17 stepper motors.
